# Constitution — Azim CRM

> Non-negotiable principles. Everything else (rules, commands, templates) derives from these.
> Evolve via `/forge:constitution` with human approval; never weaken silently.

1. **Spec is the source of truth.** Code is a derived artifact, generated or verified against the
   spec. Each artifact constrains the ambiguity of the next.
2. **Minimum necessary rigor.** Use the lowest scale level that removes ambiguity from context.
   Heavy process (full pipeline, evals) is opt-in, never default.
3. **Determinism where possible.** Manifests, schemas and deterministic validators decide
   lifecycle operations; LLM reviewers complement, never replace, them.
4. **Traceable, archivable change.** All work lives as an active change, is verified, applied to
   the baseline and archived. No silent gaps: blocked work goes to the deferral ledger and the
   project does not close until the ledger is resolved and tested.
5. **Language policy.** Identifiers in English; documentation and user-facing text in Português
   Brasileiro. "Objeto de Valor" always written in full. No technology prefixes in domain names.
6. **Financial correctness** (when the domain applies): money as integer cents, NBR 5891 rounding,
   append-only audit. Regulated flows (PCI DSS, fintech) require explicit human approval at
   archive time.
7. **Security by default.** No secrets in code, repos or images; least privilege; auditability.
8. **Human commits only.** No AI co-authorship trailers in commits or PRs. Conventional Commits.
9. **Decisions are recorded.** Architectural decisions become ADRs; human gate decisions are
   recorded with author, timestamp and reason in `approvals.yaml`.
10. **Agent-agnostic by construction.** `.forge/` is the only source; every tool consumes
    generated adapters. Switching LLM/agent must never break the flow.
