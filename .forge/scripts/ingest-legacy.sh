# tree into the baseline WITHOUT deleting or modifying the original:
#   docs/product/{prd,frd-nfrd,ddd,trd,adr,glossary} -> .forge/product/current/...
# Capabilities are NOT auto-extracted (semantic work — /forge:archive builds them
# change by change, or an agent-assisted extraction does it later).
# Refuses to run if product/current already has imported content (no silent merge).
# Usage: ingest-legacy.sh   (FORGE_ROOT overrides the repo root)
